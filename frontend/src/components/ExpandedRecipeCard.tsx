// this is going to be a lot like the RecipeCard
// but we'll want to expand on what a recipe will look like
// both in the database and in the frontend

// we'll want to add a few more fields to the recipe
// ingredients, an image, instructions, and a category
// we'll also want to be able to edit the recipe
