## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js with Chakra UI for a responsive and intuitive UI.
- **Backend:** Robust backend infrastructure with Prisma, tested with Vitest.

## Directory Structure

The project is structured as a monorepo with distinct directories for frontend and backend:

- **frontend:** Contains all UI components, pages, and frontend logic.
- **backend:** Houses the backend logic, database models, and API routes.

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root of the monorepo.

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Use the provided scripts to run the frontend or backend:

### Scripts

From the base of the monorepo, the following scripts are available:

- **Run Frontend Development Server:**

  ```bash
  yarn frontend-dev
  ```

- **Initialize Backend Development Environment:**
  ```bash
  yarn backend-dev
  ```

This script starts the backend database, runs Prisma migrations, and seeds the database with initial data if any.
